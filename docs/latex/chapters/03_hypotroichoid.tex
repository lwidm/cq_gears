\section{The Hypotrochoid (Undercut Curve)}
The parametric description of the undercut curve is significantly more complicated. Fortunately Gregelry Bencsik has made a great youtube video~\cite{undercut_YTvideo} which shows in a very intuitive way how the geometry is created and shows a relative simple way one can describe it.
